1. To view cors error go to a specific website 
such as www.google.com or www.stackoverflow.com , b
basically a website with a proper origin and not the default chrome tab

2. In allowedOrigins make sure to not put a '/' after the url of the website.
Otherwise, you will still get a CORS error.

For e.g. 
const allowedOrigins = [
    'http://localhost:5001',
    'https://www.google.com',
    'https://stackoverflow.com'
]
    
    AND not

const allowedOrigins = [
    'http://localhost:5001/',
    'https://www.google.com/',
    'https://stackoverflow.com/'
]
